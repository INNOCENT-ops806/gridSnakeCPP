# gridSnakeCPP

A fun snake game with loved ones :)

[!WARNING]

> This game is for Unix-like systems as it uses make to run the game

## Motivation

This game was created with motivation that I will be going home for the holidays and since I have younger brothers, I thought it will be cool to have something to kill time by. It is not a complex game but it will kill boredom and increase my programming skill in C++.

## Future Plans

I plan to make the game more fun and visually appealing in the future hoping I can achieve making it available online

## Technology Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Game Engine/Library:** [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
- **Build System:** Make
