# gridSnakeCPP

A fun snake game with loved ones :)

## Motivation

This game was created with motivation that I will be going home for the holidays and since I have younger brothers I thought I should make something for us to kill time by. It is not a complex game but it will kill boredom and increase my programming skill in C++.

## Future Plans

I plan to make the game more fun and visually appealing in the future hoping I can achieve making it available online

## Technology Used

The game is fully built in C++ <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white">

## Screenshot

## Contribution

If you want to improve or just help me in any way please don't be afraid I am not RUST programming language :) (I fear that language)
Hit up a pull request and I will gladly say no(I am kidding :>)
