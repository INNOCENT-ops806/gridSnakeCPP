# gridSnakeCPP

A fun snake game with loved ones :)

## Motivation

This game was created with motivation that I will be going home for the holidays and since I have younger brothers I thought I should make something for us to kill time by. It is not a complex game but it will kill boredom and increase my programming skill in C++.

## Future Plans

I plan to make the game more fun and visually appealing in the future hoping I can achieve making it available online

## Technology Used

The game is fully built in C++

## Screenshot

## **Screenshot will be provided as the game improves**

## Contribution

If you want to improve or just help me in any way please don't be afraid I am not RUST programming language :) (I fear that language)
Hit up a pull request and I will gladly say no(I am kidding :>)
